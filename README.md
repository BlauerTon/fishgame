Game Description
Fish Bubble Shooter is a fast-paced game where your goal is to score as many points as possible by shooting bullets (small red particles) from your fish to pop randomly spawning bubbles. Some bubbles bounce vertically, adding a layer of difficulty. If a non-bouncing bubble reaches the left side of the screen, the game ends.
